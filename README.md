This is a program build on the naive bayes classification technique.

The data is taken from kaggle and is a collection of 10 000 posts
that have been classified as either a story, show-hn or a ask_hn.
The model will then be able to classify unseen posts based on their
titles.


Required Packages: pandas, math, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn

To run: either use jupyter notebook or set your workig directory to src and enter 'python NaiveBayes.py'
